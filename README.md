# Machine Learning IMPL

Library containing different projects implementing Machine Learning.
The code starts from data pre-processing to model generation and testing the results of the models.

## Language Translator

An implementation using KERAS trying to develop a language translator. Model is based on a bi-directional LSTM layer so that the context is retained while translating data.

## Sentiment Analysis
